## Credits

## About

"Bone Snapper Addon for Blender" is a free and open-source Blender addon which offers different bone snapping operations like IK-to-FK, FK-to-IK, etc. It was designed to work with [Ecodelia Control Rigs](https://github.com/Ali3nSystems/Bone-Snapper-Addon-for-Blender), but it also works with other Blender rigging solutions like Rigify, etc. For now it's only meant to be used on biped rigs. There are plans to rework it and be able to add as many bone presets as the user wants instead of the predefined biped ones.

## How to Use

* Must use latest Blender version.
* Every [Ecodelia Control Rig](https://github.com/Ali3nSystems/Bone-Snapper-Addon-for-Blender) has a preset file that starts with the prefix BNSR. You can find them in the repository folder.
* After installing the addon, you can find it in the N-panel.
* Navigate to the "Bone Presets" panel, and click on the "Open Preset Directory" button.
* Copy and paste the BNSR preset files there and close the window.
* Click the 3 dots accompanied by the 3 lines in the "Bone Presets" panel and select the preset relevant to the control rig.
* Select the relevant control rig and the options should appear.
